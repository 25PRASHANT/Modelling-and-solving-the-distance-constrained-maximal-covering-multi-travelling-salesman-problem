# Modelling-and-solving-the-distance-constrained-maximal-covering-multi-travelling-salesman-problem
In this work, we discuss a variant of prize collecting travelling salesmanâ€™s problem considering the sets of salesmans, facilities and customers. Each facility can cover the patients that are within an exogenously defined distance known as coverage distance. Also, there is a limit on maximum distance travelled by each salesman while visiting the facilities. Further, a facility can be visited by at the most one salesman. Given this problem setting, the objective is to maximize the total number of customers covered by constructing Hamiltonian cycles of m salesmans over a subset of facilities.
